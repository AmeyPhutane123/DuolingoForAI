# Introduction

Welcome to the ðŸ¤— LLM Course!

This course will teach you about large language models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) using libraries from the Hugging Face ecosystem â€” ðŸ¤— Transformers, ðŸ¤— Datasets, ðŸ¤— Tokenizers, and ðŸ¤— Accelerate â€” as well as the Hugging Face Hub.

Weâ€™ll also cover libraries outside the Hugging Face ecosystem. These are amazing contributions to the AI community and incredibly useful tools.
